# video-streamer

This program has the basic functionality that mimics something like Twitch that allows a user to create streaming video channels. It only works locally and you must do an npm start for the api, the rtmpserver, and the client side individually to make it work. You also have to have the Open Broadcasting System (OBS) to actually stream to the local channel.
